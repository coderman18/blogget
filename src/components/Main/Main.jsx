        React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's used to
        create single-page applications (SPA) and reactive web applications
        (ReactJS). This is a simple example of a React component called "Main"
        with some text.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a component that uses CSS modules to style the text. The CSS is
        located in the "Main.module.css" file.
      </p>
      <hr />
    </div>
  );
}
